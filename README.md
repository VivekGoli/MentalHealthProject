# MentalHealthProject
A machine learning project to predict mental health of people
This project is based on the standard mental health questionnaire DASS 42(Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale).
The dataset used in this project has 42 attributes for the questionnaire, 10 attributes for Ten Item Personality Index and 6 attributes related to person's life (education, urban/rural, gender, age, marrital status, family size).
DecisionTree, NaiveBayes and k-Nearesr neighbour algorithms were used to build the models.
The objective of the project is to predict the severity of the depression, anxiety, stress and mental health state of the person based on the instance of his/her data.
Four Class labels can take the values 0-Normal, 1-Mild, 2-Moderate, 3-Severe, 4-Extremely severe
Decision tree algorithm gave the best accuracy and f1score among the three algorithms.
